        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          Born in West TN, educated in East TN, and currently residing in Nashville TN, I work as a controls engineer for a small employee-owned company.
          Outside of work I enjoy tinkering on my body, learning new skills, and building shit. Much of said tinkering involves fermenting things in my kitchen, ingesting the results,
            and then sweating them out (more on that inside!)
        </p>

        <p>
          Social Media platforms have always left something to be desired as an outlet for expression and as a window for others into my goings-ons.
          Maybe it's feeling like I MUST compete for glances on certain sites.
          Maybe it's the ever growing pressure to show only the most attractive side of myself.
          Maybe someone (me) who takes hours, sometimes days, to draft text messages is doomed in a world where broadcasting yourself should be impulsive + charming.
          No Dice!
        </p>

        <p>
          With that, welcome to my random corner of the internet.
          If most social media is like looking at the real estate photos of someone's home, I hope you find this site like a weeknight night hangout
            in my living room: there are tools on the kitchen table, sweaty running shoes by the door,
            a buzzing kegerator in the corner, and reruns of "Community" for ambiance.
        </p>
