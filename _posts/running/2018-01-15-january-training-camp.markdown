I've yet to have a bad time in Asheville, NC. It also happens to be a pretty good in-the-middle meetup spot for some ol' college buds/budettes. In the span of 2-3 group texts and 15 minutes on airbnb, we had a 3-day weekend getaway reuninon scoped-out. In the wake of said weekend, the streak continues, and Asheville remains in the good books. 

Fortunately, the reunion was not all about the usual tedium of delicious food and floating kegs in the hottub. Three of us were there to have some ACTUAL fun. [Cloudland Canyon 50k]({% post_url 2018-02-10-cloudland-canyon-50k-my-first-50k %}) was coming up and the mountains around Asheville are great practice terrain.
