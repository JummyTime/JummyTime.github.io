Here's a first mobile update while waiting in the airport, headed to Michigan for work. I wanted a mobile workflow to give me as much control as possible while avoiding contact with GitHub via browser. In summary - though I went through some trial and error - I ended up going with:

[Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)
- Android Linux Terminal
- a familiar interface that lets me avoid any number of lackluster git guis/apps/clients every time I switch platforms.Â **"Consistency is the second best drug"**, my grandpa always said.
- installed git and cloned this site repo
- installed openssh
  - no typing GitHub credentials over and over

[MarkdownX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryeeeeee.markdownx)
- Markdown editor for Android 
- write and preview posts then copy .md text into Termux nano editor 

ps. The Southwest check in girl gave me googly eyes and told me I look like Aaron Taylor Johnson, from his "classic" rolls, and that's " it's definitely a good thing." ðŸ˜‰
