Update" | 2017-09-23 11:03:00 -0000 | site update |
 
Here's a first mobile update while waiting in the 
airport, headed to Michigan for work. I wanted a mobile 
workflow to give me as much control as possible while 
avoiding contact with GitHub via browser. In summary - 
though I went through some trial and error - I ended up 
going with: - 
[Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)
   - Android Linux Terminal
      - a familiar interface that lets me avoid any 
number of lackluster git guis/apps/clients every time I 
switch platforms. " ** Consistency is the best drug**," 
my grandpa always said.
      - installed git and cloned this site repo
      - installed openssh
         - no typing GitHub credentials over and over - 
[MarkdownX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryeeeeee.markdownx)
   - Markdown editor for Android
      - write and preview posts then copy .md text into 
Termux nano editor ps. The Southwest check in girl gave 
me googly eyes and told me I look like Aaron Taylor 
Johnson, from his "classic" rolls, and that's " it's 
definitely a good thing." ðŸ˜‰
