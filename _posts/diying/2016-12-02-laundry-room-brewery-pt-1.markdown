**History:**

I’ve been brewing for about 6 years. It all started with eBiab in an apartment and I’ve been steadily cultivating my setup since then. Two years ago I upgraded to a two kettle eHerms, a modified [Kal clone](http://www.theelectricbrewery.com/) that was essentially mobile. I loved using the system, but I knew early on I’d need to install the setup somewhere to save myself the trouble of setup/breakdown; brew more often in less time.

Last year I bought a house and began working on this.

I wanted to complete the build before I shared the process because I live in fear of accountability for my unfinished projects.

**Summary of the project:**

The decision to install in the laundry room was long-thought-out and solved the few problems I encountered only after beginning looking for my “spot.” It really came down to HOA rules that would complicate putting the brewery in the detached garage.

To the laundry room! It contains my main sub-panel, a water supply, a workable drain, and a simple enough footprint for me to handle the necessary construction:

- exhaust fan and ducting
- new 220v circuit for concurrent use of brewing controls and clothes dryer
- FRP siding (waterproof walls)
- custom work surface that mounts above washer and dryer
- Condensate hood
