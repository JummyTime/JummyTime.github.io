<!-- excerpt -->
It seems like every competent - and worldly- computer engineer has a blog. After seven years of Controls Engineering, predominantly improving FrontEnd applications, I have decided to also force feed my thoughts to the internet, as stylishly as I can.
<!-- excerpt -->

First things first,  I will build a website with the following stack:
- *jekyll*
  - Blog posts made in easy to understand (Markup language)text files, in easy to understand/learn syntax. [jekyll docs][jekyll-docs]
  - First post made in default *Markdown* [Markdown Quick Reference][Markdown-qr]
- *github pages*
  - These sites use a jekyll engine. Simply push jeykyll files for a site, from anywhere, to a git repository and the site updates is self. It's described elsewhere as "self-aware." [github pages][github-pages]
  - Free single site hosting per user
  - Custom url support ((http://JummyTime.github.io) <=> (http://jimmy.fyi))
